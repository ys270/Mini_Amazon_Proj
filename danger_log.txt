Danger Log

1. The email sender address and password are stored in the backendServer.py code in plain text, which might be stolen by malicious adversary. 

2. When the user buy product, if the product does not exist, our server will create a new item corresponding to the user's input. The user can types in some malicious code that might be detrimental to the server.

3. The sequence number starts from 1 and increments by 1 each time. If some malicious user creates some kind of script to place order very quickly, the sequence number might exceed the maximum positive integer. Then, there will be a overflow (i.e. the sequence number will be a huge positive number, then be a huge negative number).

4. For a specific user, his/her account might be logged in from more than 1 browsers, whici is not safe. We don't know how to solve this problem in Django with our current knowledge.

5. In the backendServer.py code, when we iterate through a global dictionary, its length may change since other threads might add or delete an element of the same dictionary. 

Solution: We found that the dictionary is not thread-safe in python. So every time before we iterate through the dictionary, we acquire a mutex. After the iteration, we unlock it.
